# Hacktoberfest: cd using fzf!

A simple bash shell alias for cd'ing to directories using fuzzy file finder. 
This repository is for encouraging unexperienced people to contribute to the open-source society. There is a deliberate mistake in the .sh file. What you need to do is to fork this repository, correct the mistake, and then submit a pull request. You can also have a look at the other specifications mentioned in the file :).

Requirements:
-[fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)

Note for CodeNight participants: Sadly, fzf is not available in ineks. You need to work on this alias using own computers.
